Installation
===============

.. via PyPI
.. ---------

.. Beware, the PyPI version is not always up-to-date.

.. .. code:: bash

..     pip install triflow

.. will install the package and

.. .. code:: bash

..     pip install triflow --upgrade

.. use sudo if needed, and the user flag if you want to install it without the root privileges

.. .. code:: bash

..     pip install --user triflow

.. via Conda
.. ----------

.. The library is also available on a conda channel (not always up to date) :

.. .. code:: bash

..     conda install -c celliern triflow


via github
-----------

You can install the last version of the library using pip and the github repository:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+git://github.com/celliern/triflow.git

The library will be available in PyPI and Conda as soon as the api will be stable enough.
