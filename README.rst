Installation
============

External requirements
---------------------

This library is written for python >= 3.6.

The library is based on Theano, thus extra dependecies like fortran and
C compiler are needed, see Theano install page for extra informations:

http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html

On v0.5.0, it is possible to choose between theano and numpy (which
provide similar features). numpy will be slower but with no compilation
time, which is handy for testing and prototyping.

via PyPI
--------

.. code:: bash

    pip install triflow

will install the package and

.. code:: bash

    pip install triflow --upgrade

will update an old version of the library.

use sudo if needed, and the user flag if you want to install it without
the root privileges:

.. code:: bash

    pip install --user triflow

via github
----------

You can install the last version of the library using pip and the github
repository:

.. code:: bash

    pip install git+git://github.com/locie/triflow.git

Introduction
============

Motivation
----------

The aim of this library is to have a (relatively) easy way to write
transient dynamic systems with 1D finite difference discretization, with
fast temporal solvers.

The main two parts of the library are:

-  symbolic tools defining the spatial discretization, with boundary
   taking into account in a separated part
-  a fast temporal solver written in order to use the sparsity of the
   finite difference method to reduce the memory and CPU usage during
   the solving

Moreover, extra tools are provided and the library is written in a
modular way, allowing an easy extension of these different parts (see
the plug-in module of the library.)

The library fits well with an interactive usage (in a jupyter notebook).
The dependency list is actually larger, but on-going work target a
reduction of the stack complexity.

Model writing
-------------

All the models are written as function generating the F vector and the
Jacobian matrix of the model defined as

.. math::

    \frac{\partial U}{\partial t} = F(U)

The symbolic model is written as a simple mathematic equation. For
example, a diffusion advection model can be written as:

.. code:: python

    from triflow import Model

    equation_diff = "k * dxxU - c * dxU"
    dependent_var = "U"
    physical_parameters = ["k", "c"]

    model = Model(equation_diff, dependent_var, physical_parameters)

Example
-------

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    import pylab as pl
    from triflow import Model, Simulation

    model = Model("k * dxxU - c * dxU",
                  "U", ["k", "c"])

    x, dx = np.linspace(0, 1, 200, retstep=True)
    U = np.cos(2 * np.pi * x * 5)
    fields = model.fields_template(x=x, U=U)

    parameters = dict(c=.03, k=.001, dx=dx, periodic=False)

    t = 0
    dt = 5E-1
    tmax = 2.5

    pl.plot(fields.x, fields.U, label=f't: {t:g}')


    def dirichlet_condition(t, fields, pars):
        fields.U[0] = 1
        fields.U[-1] = 0
        return fields, pars


    simul = Simulation(model, t, fields, parameters, dt,
                       hook=dirichlet_condition, tmax=tmax)

    for i, (t, fields) in enumerate(simul):
        print(f"iteration: {i}\t",
              f"t: {t:g}", end='\r')
        pl.plot(fields.x, fields.U, label=f't: {t:g}')

    pl.xlim(0, 1)
    legend = pl.legend(loc='best')

    pl.show()

NEWS
----

v0.4.7: - adding tensor flow support with full testing - adding
post-processing in bokeh fields display

v0.4.12: - give user choice of compiler - get out tensorflow compiler
(not really efficient, lot of maintenance trouble) - give access to
theano and numpy compiler - upwind scheme support - using xarray as
fields backend, allowing easy post process and save - update display and
containers - adding repr string to all major classes

v0.5.0: - move schemes from plugins to core - compilers: remove
tensorflow, add numpy - displays and containers are connected to the
simulation via ``streamz`` - add post-processing. - real-time display is
now based on `Holoviews <https://holoviews.org/>`__. Backward
compatibility will be ensured until 0.8.0, but you are encouraged to
quickly update your files.

ROADMAP / TODO LIST
-------------------

The following items are linked to a better use of solid external libs:

-  change all the display and container workflow:

   -  use streamz to allow pipeline like way to add display / probing /
      post-process
   -  use holoviews as main way to do real-time plotting
   -  use xarray multi netcdf files to reduce IO lack of performance

-  better use of external solving lib:

   -  merge triflow.plugins.schemes and scipy.integrate.OdeSolver API
   -  use scipy.integrate.solve_ivp for triflow temporal scheme solving
      (making it more robust)
   -  main goal is to have better two-way integration with scipy

These are linked to the triflow core

-  build a robust boundary condition API
-  work on dimension extension, allowing 2D resolution and more
-  allow auxiliary function to make some complex model easier to write
-  allow a choice on the finite difference scheme, on a global way or
   term by term
-  test and propose other compilers (Cython, numba, pythran?)
-  work on adaptive spatial and temporal mesh

These are far away but can be very interesting:

-  implement continuation algorithm working with triflow (separate
   project?)
-  try other kind of discretisation scheme (separate project each?)

   -  Finite volume
   -  Finite element?

The final (and very ambitious goal) is to provide a robust framework
allowing to link the mathematical language (and a natural way to write
the model, as natural as possible) with a high performance and robust
solving of the numerical system. There is a trade-off between the ease
of use and the performance, for this software, all mandatory
dependencies have to be pip-installable (as opposite to dedalus project
or fenics project), even if some non-mandatory dependencies can be
harder to install.

If we go that further, it may be interesting to split the project with
the triflow language, the different spatial discretisation and so onâ€¦
